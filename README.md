# Transfer-learning
Pneumonia detection using Transfer Learning.

# Overview:
This is a **computer vision** problem,where we try to detect whether a person is suffering form Pnuemonia or not using [Transfer learning](https://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/).

# Motivation:
In India there are only 6 doctors for every 10000 people.There is huge gap that need to addressed.There are certain poor people in every part of our country especially in villages who can't afford to just go to cities for diagnosis.So,I've tried to build a model that predicts whether a person has pneumonia or not by analyzing x-ray images.We are just scratching the surface,actually there is a great depth that need to be explored in the **Medical field.**

# Dataset Overview:
You can download the Pneumonia dataset from(kaggle) [here](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).Pneumonia dataset is organized in to 3 folders(**train,val,test**).Each folder consists of two sub-folders namely **NORMAL** and **PNEUMONIA** .Threre are a total of **5863** images(JPEG).All these images were graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system.

# Technologies used:
[Keras](https://keras.io) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
# Credits
A huge shoutout to [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for the amazing dataset.
